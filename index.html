            <p>San Francisco has multiple recently built green infrastructure projects. Along 14 blocks of Sunset Boulevard,
                rain gardens capture water running off the street. Holloway Avenue has eight blocks of permeable pavement
                and
                bioretention planters (curbside planters designed to capture water). Some other streets have added green
                “bulb-outs”—curb extensions at intersections that make it easier for people to cross the street and that
                create
                extra space for plants and water storage. In a city park, a stream that was put in an underground channel in
                the
                past will be “daylighted,” bringing it back to the surface where it can capture rain that otherwise would
                have
                flowed into the sewer system and out to the ocean. </p>
            <p>
                “Green infrastructure has an important role to play in helping San Francisco adapt to climate change,” says
                Joseph Sweiss, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. It can also boost
                biodiversity,
                and trees can add shade to fight the urban heat island effect. It also provides a buffer for the sewer
                system by
                reducing runoff; like many older cities, San Francisco has a combined sewer system, meaning that it collects
                wastewater and rainwater together, and pipes can easily be overwhelmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, the city’s new projects are happening at a relatively small scale. “What we’ve seen now is a lot of
                good
                pilot projects and a sprinkling of these projects in a lot of urban areas. That’s great. People are seeing
                that
                those things can work,” says Dave Smith, principal at Water Innovation Services, who spent three decades
                working
                on water issues at the Environmental Protection Agency. “But what is challenging is making this kind of the
                standard operating procedure wherever anybody’s doing new paving, new street development, new land
                development,
                so that it becomes more of a standard practice.”

            <h2>Then there’s the fundamental challenge</h2>
            <p>In some neighborhoods, green infrastructure and improvements to traditional sewers can’t necessarily prevent
                flooding during extreme storms. It’s possible that some people may eventually need to move from the
                hardest-hit
                areas</p>
